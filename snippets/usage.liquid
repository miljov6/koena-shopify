<p>We recommend conducting a patch test prior to using Ko&eacute;na, especially if you are aware that your skin is particularly sensitive, or if you have experienced reactivity issues with other topical creams.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re comfortable after conducting your patch test, apply cream liberally to the skin 3 to 4 times per day (or you may wish to apply it more frequently if required).</p>
<p>Ko&eacute;na is suitable for the whole family including children of all ages and those with skin prone to eczema, psoriasis &amp; dermatitis. Please discontinue use if irritation or rash occurs.</p>
